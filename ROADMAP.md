# Roadmap

[Initial Roadmap slides from the LF Energy Design Team on "virtualization"](/roadmap-docs/SEAPATH%20Initial%20Roadmap%20-%20final%20version.pptx)

## First priorities
- Specifying the requirements to be fulfilled by the reference platform
- Specifying the test procedures needed to assess the fulfillment of the requirements
- Building and improving the appropriate system(s) architecture(s) for the software platform and specifying requirements for hardware architecture
- Setting up a continuous integration of the software platform
- Building IEC 61850 testing tools
- Testing the fulfillment of the requirements for automation applications after the implementation, as a proof-of-concept, of a realistic automation system on top of the integrated software platform \*

*\* Although the MVP targets both automation and protection applications, with a realistic ambition to reach a qualified industrial-grade implementation by end of 2023, the project will strive to qualify an intermediate version of the platform for automation applications by end of 2021.*

## Second priorities
- Developing code for the specific functions and services to be delivered by the platform
- Defining and implementing APIs to external applications
- Testing the fulfillment of the requirements for protection applications after the implementation, as a proof-of-concept, of a realistic protection and automation system on top of the integrated software platform
- Defining guidelines and best practices to test, integrate, deploy, and maintain the applications on such platform
