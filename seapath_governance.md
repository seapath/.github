# Overview

The SEAPATH project is governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in the SEAPATH project is open and not bound to corporate affiliation. Participants are bound to the project's Code of Conduct.

### Project Owner

SEAPATH is part of the [LF Energy Foundation](https://www.lfenergy.org/), a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects within the energy and electricity sectors.

### Technical Charter

The Project's [Technical Charter](https://github.com/lf-energy/foundation/blob/main/project_charters/seapath_charter.pdf) sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the SEAPATH Project.

# Project roles

## Contributor

The contributor role is the starting role for anyone participating in the SEAPATH project and wishing to contribute code.

### Process for becoming a contributor

Review the Contribution Guidelines to ensure your contribution is in line with the project's coding and styling guidelines.
Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO signoff.
Have your submission approved by the committer(s) and merged into the codebase.

## Committer

Committers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases, they are programmers, but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role. Typically, a committer will focus on a specific aspect of the project and bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project owner. A committer cannot validate his own contribution

- Committers/Reviewers: Eloi Bail, Mathieu Dupré, Aurélien Wataré, Florent Carli, Robin Massink, Erwann Roussy

### Process for becoming a committer

Show your experience with the codebase through contributions and engagement on the community channels.
Request to become a committer. To do this, create a new pull request that adds your name and details to the Committers File file and request existing committers to approve.
After the majority of committers approve you, merge in the PR. Be sure to tag the whoever is managing the GitHub permissions to update the committers team on GitHub.

### Responsibilities

The project is split into several repositories. There is at least one Committer in charge of each repository. By "in charge", we mean:
-   best effort to review the pull request,
-   best effort to resolve issues,
-   building and publishing the releases, including writing the release notes and informing the community,

### When does a committer lose committer status

In case of unability to perform its responsability, the Committer in charge has to ask the TSC through the list [SEAPATH-TSC@lists.lfenergy.org](mailto:SEAPATH-TSC@lists.lfenergy.org) to find another Committer to review the pull request, resolve the issue or build and publish the release.
If a committer is no longer interested or cannot perform the committer duties anymore, they should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases, this can also occur by a vote of the committers per the voting process below.

## Lead

The project committers will elect a lead (and optionally a co-lead) who will be the primary point of contact for the SEAPATH project and representative to the TAC upon becoming an Active stage project. The lead(s) will be responsible for the overall project health and direction, coordination of activities, and working with other projects and committees as needed for the continued growth of the project.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is composed of voting members elected by the active Committers as described in the project’s Technical Charter. The TSC is responsible for the technical direction of the project.

### Members
SEAPATH TSC voting members are:
- RTE: Bastien Desbos
- GE: David Macdonald
- Savoir-faire Linux: Eloi Bail
- Schneider: Alban Denat
- Welotec: Jan Hille

# Release Process

Project releases will occur on a scheduled basis as agreed to by the committers.

# Conflict resolution and voting

While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis. The simple majority is needed to approve proposals.
The preferred way to vote is to create a poll [here](https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/SEAPATH-tsc/addpoll).

# Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the Code of Conduct, the SEAPATH project will keep all communication on open channels (mailing list, slack).
